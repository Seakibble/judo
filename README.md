# Highlights
I often find myself trying to apply web development to things I'm interested in. I've been training Judo for two and a half years, and I started working on this because I was struggling to remember what the different Japanese terms meant. Judo is very literal in its technique names, so if you know what the Japanese means, the name of the technique tells you what to do. So I built this glossary to familiarize myself with the 40 or so official techniques, and to help solidify my knowledge of the terms. Now my understanding of the terms is very strong.

This was an interesting challenge to work on. I knew I wanted a real time searching feature right from the beginning, and getting that working was very satisfying.
